_**Hello**_  
My name is JoÃ£o Pedro Castro, but you can call me TheOrtsac!  
I am a person from Brazil, that really likes programming!  
ðŸ§’ - I started programming as a little 9 years old kid, back then I had only one wish in my life: _Make games_. Then I downloaded [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker), and started learning GML, it was really fun, but when I reached 10 I just wanted to do other things in my life, so I stopped programming.
