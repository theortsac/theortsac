## **Hello!**  
ðŸ‘‹ - My name is JoÃ£o Pedro Castro, but you can call me TheOrtsac!  
ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· - I am a person from Brazil, that really likes programming!  
ðŸ§’ - I started programming as a little 9 years old kid, back then I had only one wish in my life: _Make games_. Then I downloaded [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker), and started learning GML (or GameMaker Language), it was really fun, but when I reached 10 I just wanted to do other things in my life, so I stopped programming.  
ðŸŽ® - I started playing tons of video games, and I just decided to get back at creating games, I created lots of games, and the most part of them was really fun, but my programming was really bad.  
ðŸ’» - Then I deciced as a 12 years old to get good at programming, and started learning python, and program a lot!  
Now I am 13 and decided to keep going on my programming journey! If you want to get in contact with me, just send a email to: _**jpgcdc@gmail.com**_
